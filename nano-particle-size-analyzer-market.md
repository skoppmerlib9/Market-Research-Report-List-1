<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nano Particle Size Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dynamic Light Scattering</li><li>Laser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nanoparticle size analyzer market encompasses various techniques, with two prominent methods being Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and laser diffraction. DLS measures the size of nanoparticles by analyzing the scattering of laser light caused by motion due to Brownian motion, providing rapid results for particles typically in the range of 1 nm to 1 Âµm. Laser diffraction, on the other hand, measures the angle and intensity of scattered light to determine particle size distribution, effective for larger particles and a wider size range. Both techniques are essential for applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and nanotechnology.</p></p>
