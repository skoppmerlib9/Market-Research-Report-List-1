<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Breakaway Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Separation Via Breaking Pins</li><li>Separation Via Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Safety Breakaway Couplings market comprises two primary types: separation via breaking pins and separation via cable. Breakaway couplings using breaking pins operate by employing designed pins that fracture under excessive force, allowing pipes or hoses to disconnect safely to prevent spills or damage. In contrast, couplings utilizing cables achieve separation through a cable mechanism, which releases tension and disconnects when subjected to certain stresses. Both types enhance safety in fluid transfer applications by minimizing risk during unintended separations.</p></p>
