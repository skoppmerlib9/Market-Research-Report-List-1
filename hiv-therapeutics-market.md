<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HIV Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nucleoside-Analog Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)</li><li>Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)</li><li>Entry and Fusion Inhibitors</li><li>Protease Inhibitors (PIs)</li><li>Integrase Inhibitors</li><li>Coreceptor Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HIV therapeutics market is segmented into various drug classes, each targeting different stages of the viral lifecycle. Nucleoside-Analog Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) block reverse transcription, while Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) bind to the reverse transcriptase enzyme, inhibiting its function. Entry and Fusion Inhibitors prevent viral entry into host cells, whereas Protease Inhibitors (PIs) disrupt viral replication. Integrase Inhibitors block the integration of viral DNA into the host genome, and Coreceptor Antagonists prevent HIV from entering cells by blocking co-receptors.</p></p>
