<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Occupational Radiation Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Dosimeters</li><li>Active Dosimeters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Occupational radiation monitoring involves two main types of dosimeters: passive and active. Passive dosimeters, such as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and film badges, collect and store radiation exposure data over time without requiring a power source. They are typically read after periods of use. In contrast, active dosimeters provide real-time radiation measurements, using electronic components to continuously monitor exposure levels. This immediate feedback allows for prompt decision-making regarding safety, enhancing protection for workers in radiation-related occupations.</p></p>
